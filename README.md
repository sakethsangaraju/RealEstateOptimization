# RealEstateOptimization
Use of Genetic Algorithms and 2 niching methods (Crowding Distance and Sharing Function), this project attempts to explore the use of evolutionary computation to optimize financial portfolios in real-world applications. To this end, we use real estate data to mitigate financial risks and adapt to dynamic market conditions.
